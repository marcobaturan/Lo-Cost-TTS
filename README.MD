# Low-Cost TTS

    Module for computational low-cost custom TTS.
    Working as an alternative to ML cloning voice. 
    And avoid the problem of a computer without
    much RAM or CPU or GPU. It is useful for
    Cloning a basic human voice. 
    In this URL, you can find a list in many languages of the frequent basic 1000
    words, just copy the list into vocabulary.txt and then start to teach to
    the computer to imitate your voice.

## Documentation

    $ ./install_complements.sh
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt 
    $ python main.py

    You need a vocabulary file in the main folder with 1000 to 3000 most frequent words in the
    language target. Or get a big batch from your text dataset extracted from your data mining.
    The example in the folder is just for orientation.
